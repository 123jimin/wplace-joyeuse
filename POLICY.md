# Our Policies

(TODO: écrire une version française.)

## Introduction

When I first started the project, I picked a place where it would not overlap existing artworks,
and I was careless about local people being passionate about their communes.

Thankfully, people who were doing projects at Joyeuse commune was very understanding, so we thank them for their willingness to collaborate.

Unfortunately, we since had a conflict, which has fortunately has been resolved.
However, we don't want to have such conflicts again, so we agreed upon a set of policies to not cause unwanted conflicts with others.

## The Policies

This applies to the *chart* (tall vertical rectangle), the *Joyeuse jacket* (image near Joyeuse commune), and the *logo* above it.

These are our policies:

- A "local" artwork means that it's something that's significant to the local people (like flags).
- Margins are 15-pixel wide black areas left and right to the chart.
- "Aggressive" means overwriting a significant portion of others' artworks without warning.

| Type of Artwork | Amount of Intersection | Policy |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| Any | None | We have no problem with it, even when it "touches" our project. |
| Local | Margins Only | We will very likely not attempt to remove it. Even when we do, we should attempt negotiations first, and should not be aggressive. |
| Not Local | Margins Only | We may attempt to remove it, but "not aggressively". |
| Local | A Lot | We may attempt removing it, but we should not be aggressive. We should attempt negotiations first. |
| Not Local | A Lot | We may attempt removing it, and we may be aggressive if the other side is aggressively drawing theirs. |
