Here is the instruction on how you can help drawing Joyeuse.

### Zoomed-In

If you can't use BlueMarble, use this image to draw instead.

## Setting BlueMarble

[BlueMarble](https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble) is a userscript for overlaying template images on wplace.

Follow the installation guide written on there, but for one-click-installing the script, **do this instead**:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/releases) page.
2. Click the title of the latest release.
3. Scroll down. Under "Assets", click `BlueMarble.user.js`.
4. If Tampermonkey has been installed correctly, then you should be greeted with the installation page.

On mobile, Firefox is one of browsers that support Tampermonkey.

The template coordinates for BlueMarble are: **1048 738 86 425**.

## Drawing

You should only use one of 31 default colors to draw the image.

You may draw any part of the image, but for maximal effectiveness, here is a non-mandatory guideline.

- Draw the earlier part of the chart first.
- Draw notes and outlines of lasers first.
- When drawing lines, draw them sparsely first.
- When filling in areas, spray the dots.
