# Let's Draw Joyeuse!

This is an ongoing project by [Sound Voltex](https://wplace.live/join?id=01989f5c-68ff-7a63-8f28-d965e94dbab1) alliance to draw a part of *Joyeuse VVD*, an infamous Sound Voltex chart, above *Joyeuse, France*.

### Zoomed-In

This is the zoomed-in image of current section we're working on: (TODO)

If you can't use BlueMarble, use this image to draw instead.

## Setting BlueMarble

[BlueMarble](https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble) is a userscript for overlaying template images on wplace.

Follow the installation guide written on there, but for one-click-installing the script, **do this instead**:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/releases) page.
2. Click the title of the latest release.
3. Scroll down. Under "Assets", click `BlueMarble.user.js`.
4. If Tampermonkey has been installed correctly, then you should be greeted with the installation page.

On mobile, Firefox is one of browsers that support Tampermonkey.

The template coordinates for BlueMarble are: **1048 738 86 425**.

## Drawing

You should only use one of 31 default colors to draw the image.

You may draw any part of the image, but for maximal effectiveness, here are non-mandatory guidelines.

- Draw the earlier part of the chart first.
- Draw notes and outlines of lasers first.
- When drawing lines, draw them sparsely first.
- When filling in areas, spray the dots.

Currently, the bottom two rows are occupied by a different art. Leave the bottom two rows as-is.
